## Multilingual Spam Reviews Detection Based on Pre-Trained Word Embedding  and Weighted Swarm Support Vector Machines

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting spam reviews across multiple languages using a combination of **pre-trained word embeddings** and **Weighted Swarm Support Vector Machines (WS-SVM)**. The goal is to improve spam detection accuracy by leveraging the power of deep learning-based word embeddings along with an optimized SVM approach.


## ✨ Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Detects spam reviews in different languages.  
- **Pre-Trained Word Embeddings**: Utilizes embeddings like Word2Vec, FastText, or BERT.  
- **Weighted Swarm Optimization**: Enhances SVM performance using an intelligent weight-based optimization.  
- **Robust Classification**: Effectively differentiates between genuine and spam reviews.  
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to other datasets and languages.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍  
- **NumPy & Pandas** 📊  
- **NLTK & SpaCy** 📝  
- **Scikit-Learn & SVM** 🤖
